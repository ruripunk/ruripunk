### Hello!

I'm Ruri, an internet dork with ADHD and autism.

- I've been fascinated with computers all my life and developed a bit of a connection towards them (hence [my name](https://srtmoo.net/mediawiki/index.php/Ruri_Hoshino))
- I've noticed that retro computers and consoles are capable of many great things with a fraction of the power we have today, and I want to spend my free time sharing tips, guides, and tooling for those who feel they require modern technology
